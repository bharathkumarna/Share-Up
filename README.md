# Share-Up Grocery Management Application

Description -

* Created an ionic application which is useful for people living together in shared rooms/apartments for spending money smartly and share wisely on grocery items.
* Designed the database schema to store user details, group members, and their respective grocery lists in JSON-like documents backed by MongoDB/mLab.
* Found grocery deals using AngularJS by calling Walmart Open API.
* Nearby grocery stores(using Foursquare API) and its weather conditions(using OpenWeatherMap API) based on user proximity in Google Maps(using Geolocation API) are displayed.
* Created a Forum Page that allows users to post ads regarding excess groceries which they want to share.
